            <div>
                <p>
                    It should support any site that uses Widevine/PlayReady, however we do have a list of sites we do
                    not allow our provided devices to be used with. If the site uses custom/non-standard requests with
                    the license server, you will need to implement this yourself, ex: modifying the getwvkeys script.
